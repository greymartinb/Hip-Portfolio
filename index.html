                  <p class= "articleText">Stay woke became a watch word in parts of the black community for those who were self-aware, questioning the dominant paradigm and striving for something better. But stay woke and woke became part of a wider discussion in 2014, immediately following the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The word woke became entwined with the Black Lives Matter movement; instead of just being a word that signaled awareness of injustice or racial tension, it became a word of action.

                  <p class= "articleText"> The broader uses of woke are still very much in flux, and there are some who are woke to the broader implications of woke:</p>

                  <p class= "blockquote">“Woke” feels a little bit like Macklemore rapping in one of his latest tracks about how his whiteness makes his rap music more acceptable to other white people. The conundrum is built in. When white people aspire to get points for consciousness, they walk right into the cross hairs between allyship and appropriation.

                  <h1>Why I did It</h1>
                    <p class= "articleText">
                      I always had the interest in exploring a range of styles and acestics for front-end design. The goal was to actually follow my interest where-ever it might lead, ignoring a user freindly UI. 
                      This is one of the results, a Hipster Website. There are plenty of UI designs that actually look like the "Hipster Website". Like 90% of Wordpress. </p>
                    <p class= "articleText">
                      I'm not going to deny that they don't look clean, and are user freindly, I just find them boring. A little bland, and a more just exactly the same as everyone else's. Which is fine. Just boring. </p>
                    <p class= "articleText">
                      So the Vintage Website is born! Made plenty of dumb mistakes, and I still not entirely "Happy" with the final product, but if you stare at anything for 2 days straight, then you won't be able to tell if its any good or not. </p>

                  <ol>
                    <li> Originally set out to design something that would have looked like a slightly more colorful wordpress template.</li>
                    <li> Found inspiration from various sources and set about re-creating and modifying effects</li>
                    <li> After I found the border image I used a color picker to pull some of the darker colors</li>
                    <li> Used those colors for the title color wheel</li> 
                    <li> Used Text Shadow to create black 3d stack</li>
                    <li> Found super userful turn.js,  which creates the pages and the page flippping effect</li>
                    <li> Layout, layout, layout!</li>
